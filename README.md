## ADAS Routine <a name="AR"></a>

## Electron Energy Distribution Function <a name="EEDF"></a>

The Electron Energy Distribution Function(EEDF), was used to determine the ionization and recombination rate coefficient of ions within the plasma.
For the ionization rate coefficient it is simply a convolution bewtween the ionization crosssection of the ions and the EEDF. A typical ionization crosssection is shown in fig. the convolution witht the EEDF resulted in fig..

In the python scripts, there are several functions that were used to generate toy EEDF. The Maxwellian EEDF was encoded in (func). As a slight perturbation to the Maxwellian distribution, the Kappa distribution was also included in the simulation.
