Steps to get adas7#3 running outside the ADAS environment
=========================================================

1. A number of source files are required from central ADAS. The
   copy_central_adas7#3 script copies these from the central
   location, given by the ADASTOP environment variable, to a
   local sub-directory named central/. The copy script makes
   this sub-directory in the directory from where it is launched.

2. Edit the compilation script, fortran/comp_7#3 to alter the 
   central ADAS sub-directory locations to central/.

   eg. change $ADASTOP/fortran/adaslib/utility/xxslen.for \
       to     central/xxslen.for \

   Either set CC, COMPILER, EXTRAFF and BIN via environment
   variables or replace with the actual commands or required
   destinations. Some recommendations are
      CC : gcc -c
      COMPILER : gfortran
      EXTRAFF : -g -O2 -mcmodel=large
      BIN : bin/
   For the latter make sure a bin/ directory is created.

3. The binary accepts command line arguments, 3 adf04 files
   specifying the two adf04 files to merge and the output
   file, followed by a log file. Command line options to
   specify the preferred source of energy levels and transitions
   as well as the format of the configurations are optional.
   
   Usage: adas7#5.x [options] adf04_1 adf04_2 adf04_output
             -l 1 (or 2) to select preferred adf04 file for levels
             -t 1 (or 2) to select preferred adf04 file for transitions
             -c eissner (or standard) for choice of the format of
                        configurations in the output adf04 file

   eg. offline_adas/adas7#5/bin/adas7#5.x \
                  /home/adas/adas/adf04/nist#26/ic#fe2.dat \
                  /home/adas/adas/adf04/crlike/crlike_nrb13#fe2.dat \
                  fe2_revised.dat \
                  paper-fe2.txt \
                  -l 1 -t 2 -c eissner
